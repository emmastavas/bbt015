1. How many genes are on chromosome II in saccharomyces_cerevisiare_R64-2-1_20150113.gff?

	Command: grep -w 'gene' data/saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-2-1_20150113.gff | grep -wc 'chrII'
	Output: 463

There are 463 genes in chromosome II in the yeast genome. Since gene occurs several times in lines chrII was chosen as the last grep word to avoid overcalculation. 

2. Gount GC content in S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa

	Command: grep -v '^>' data/S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa > results/results_190204/noheadline.txt #remove  headline 
		 tr -d '\n' < results/results_190204/noheadline.txt > results/results_190204/nonewline.txt  #To remove newlines
		 grep -o '[GC]' results/results_190204/nonewline.txt | wc -l #Filter G and C which in the output will be on a new row  each letter. wc the lines.
	Output: 4637676

The GC content is 4637676 bases in the reference genome. 
		
3. Dowload and decompress the ORFs of strain Y55 from https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/strains/Y55/Y55_SGD_2015_JRIF00000000/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa.gz

	a) Compare GC content in this file with the value in 2. 

	Commands: grep -v '^>' data/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa > results/results_190204/noheadlineY55.txt
		  tr -d '\n' < results/results_190204/noheadlineY55.txt > results/results_190204/nonewlineY55.txt
		  grep -o '[GC]' results/results_190204/nonewlineY55.txt | wc -l
	Output: 3191935

	b) Compare number of ORFs in this strain with the number in the reference genome
	
	Y55 genome:
	
		Command: grep '^>' data/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | wc -l #grep all lines (ORFs) and count them 
		Output: 5330
	
	(Noteworthy is that if the same command is run but 'ORF' is used insted of '^>' the output is 5329, which I am not sure 		why. Maybe there is an error in the file?)
		
	S288C genome: 	
		
		Command: grep '^>' data/orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta | wc -l
		Output: 6713

	c) Count the common ORFs between this yeast strain and the reference previously worked with in 1. and 2. 
	
	Y55 genome and S288C genome:
	
		Commands: grep -o '^>Y......' data/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa | sort > results/results_190205/sorted_Y55.txt  #Grab 				  annotation only from Y55 strain
			  grep -o '^>.......' data/orf_coding_all_R64-2-1_20150113.fasta | sort > results/results_190205/sorted_S288C.txt #Grab annotations from original strain 
			  comm -12 results/results_190205/sorted_Y55.txt results/results_190205/sorted_S288C.txt | wc -l #Take the common ORFs (-12 mean removing the first and second column of comm output which we are not interested in) and pipe into wc for lines (each common orf will be on an own line)
		Output: 5168
		
	There are 5168 common ORfs between the strains.
