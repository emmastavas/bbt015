1. How many genes are on chromosome II in saccharomyces_cerevisiare_R64-2-1_20150113.gff ?

2. Gount GC content in S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa

3. Dowload and decompress the ORFs of strain Y55 from https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/strains/Y55/Y55_SGD_2015_JRIF00000000/Y55_JRIF00000000_SGD_cds.fsa.gz

	a) Compare GC content in this file with the value in 2. 

	b) Compare number of ORFs in this strain with the number in the reference genome

	c) Count the common ORFs between this yeast strain and the reference previously worked with in 1. and 2.
